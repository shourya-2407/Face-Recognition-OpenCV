# OpenCV
Face Detection using  Open CV
Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in digital images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.
OpenCV-Python is the python API for OpenCV. You can think of it as a python wrapper around the C++ implementation of OpenCV. OpenCV-Python is not only fast (since the background consists of code written in C/C++) but is also easy to code and deploy(due to the Python wrapper in foreground). This makes it a great choice to perform computationally intensive programs.
# How to use the Code
I have divided my Code in two parts.
The first part of Code is 'Collecting Dataset'. It uses  our webcam to take snapshots of our face and then collects it in a file, in a specified location on your system.
The Second part of the Code is 'Training and Testing' which will first train the model on your face and then will test the Code to lock and unlock.
