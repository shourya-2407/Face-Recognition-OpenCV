# OpenCV
Face Detection using  Open CV
Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in digital images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.
OpenCV-Python is the python API for OpenCV. You can think of it as a python wrapper around the C++ implementation of OpenCV. OpenCV-Python is not only fast (since the background consists of code written in C/C++) but is also easy to code and deploy(due to the Python wrapper in foreground). This makes it a great choice to perform computationally intensive programs.
